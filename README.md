## 🔗 What is SideShift Pay API?

**SideShift** is a cryptocurrency exchange service that enables instant, non-custodial token swaps without requiring user accounts.

### Why SideShift Powers SwapCart

**SideShift Pay API** provides:
- **100+ Token Support**: BTC, ETH, SOL, USDT, USDC, DOGE, and more
- **Non-Custodial**: No one controls user funds during swaps
- **No KYC Required**: Privacy-focused, instant swaps
- **Fixed-Rate Swaps**: Price locked at order creation
- **Instant Processing**: Swaps complete in seconds
- **API-First Design**: Perfect for payment gateway integration

### How SideShift Integration Works

```javascript
// 1. Create Swap Order via SideShift API
POST https://sideshift.ai/api/v2/shifts
{
  "depositMethod": "btc",      // Customer pays in Bitcoin
  "settleMethod": "usdttrc20",  // Merchant receives USDT (TRC-20)
  "depositAmount": "0.0005",    // Amount customer sends
  "affiliateId": "your-id"      // Your affiliate ID
}

// 2. SideShift Returns
{
  "depositAddress": "bc1q...",  // Customer sends BTC here
  "settleAddress": "TXyz...",   // Merchant receives USDT here
  "depositAmount": "0.0005",
  "settleAmount": "15.42"       // Guaranteed USDT merchant gets
}

// 3. Customer Sends Payment
// → Blockchain transaction to depositAddress

// 4. SideShift Detects Payment
// → Automatically swaps BTC to USDT
// → Sends USDT to merchant's settleAddress

// 5. Merchant Receives Stablecoin
// → Zero volatility exposure
// → Transaction complete
```

### SideShift Advantages for Merchants
